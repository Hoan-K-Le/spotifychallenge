## Spotify Challenge

This project is part of John Crickett's Coding challenges.

This is a simple Spotify client that uses the Spotify API to show profile, list playlists and a simple web player to play songs.

Main goal I wanted to get out of this is to still practice my Redux/TypeScript while having to use the Spotify API and understanding it on a deeper level.
